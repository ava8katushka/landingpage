## Leetcode problem
https://leetcode.com/problems/divide-two-integers/

How do we do division if we couldn't use multiplication or division? 
The easiest way: we just substract or diviser from the dividend until there is nothing to substract.
# Easy but slow
```
if not dividend:
	return 0
sign = 1 if (dividend > 0 and divisor < 0) or (dividend < 0 and divisor > 0) else 0
dividend = abs(dividend)
divisor = abs(divisor)
res = 0
while dividend >= divisor:
	dividend -= divisor
	res += 1
return -res if sign else res
```

Only problem with that.. It's too slow. 
# Fast solution
We want to speed up the process by substracting not the divisor, but divisor multiplied by something. 
But we couldn't multiply directly due to the task conditions.
How do we do than ? 
We use the fact that **bitwise left shift is equal to multiplying by two**:
101 << 1 = 1010 
So we shift the divisor left as much as we can before substracting: 
```
if not dividend:
	return 0
sign = 1 if (dividend > 0 and divisor < 0) or (dividend < 0 and divisor > 0) else 0
dividend = abs(dividend)
divisor = abs(divisor)
res = 0
while dividend >= divisor:
	k = 0
	while dividend >= divisor << (k + 1):
		k += 1
	dividend -= (divisor << k)
	res += (1 << k)
return -res if sign else res
```
# The final solution
The last thing we need to do is to account for the max number: 
```
if not dividend:
	return 0
sign = 1 if (dividend > 0 and divisor < 0) or (dividend < 0 and divisor > 0) else 0
dividend = abs(dividend)
divisor = abs(divisor)
res = 0
while dividend >= divisor:
	k = 0
	while dividend >= divisor << (k + 1):
		k += 1
	dividend -= (divisor << k)
	res += (1 << k)
MAX_INT =  (1 << 31) - 1
return -res if sign else (res if res <= MAX_INT else MAX_INT)
```
