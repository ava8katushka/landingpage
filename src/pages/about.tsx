        <p>Hi there! My name is Ava! </p>
        <p>
          I have B.S. in Computer Science at the top Russian University - MIPT.
           My first job was developing a distributed load test at SRE intern in Google NY.
          After that I was offered a job at Google Munich and explored my career interests, being SRE, SWE and UXE.
          At some point I decided to try myself as entrepreneur: with hosting masterminds, selling my art and teaching Computer Science.
          I teached 80+ PMs introduction to Tech, and created my own Course on Algorithms and Data Structures for Software Engineers.
          I also made major improvements to Mozilla Firefox downloadâ€™s panel as a part of Outreachy program.
        </p>
        <p>
          This is the site for the Algorithms Book I'm writting. I hope it goes handy for Software Engineers, who want to deepen their understanding of Computer Science.
